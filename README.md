# NeRF_Capsule

Internverse is a web-based platform that transforms a single photo or video into a 3D memory using Nerfstudio. Microsoft Interns are able to upload a photo/video onto the platform from a moment during their internship (i.e. team lunches, intern socials, and project presentations), and our system reconstructs the scene into an immersive 3D experience. These “capsules” are then displayed in a scrollable community gallery, creating a shared, interactive memory collage of intern life at Microsoft.

This project unites cutting-edge neural rendering with nostalgic storytelling, making it easy for anyone to relive their best memories - and explore the experiences of other interns - in a visually rich and dynamic way.
